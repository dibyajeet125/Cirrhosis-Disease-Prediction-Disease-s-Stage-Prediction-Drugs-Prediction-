Cirrhosis Disease Prediction, Disease's Stage Prediction &amp; Drugs Prediction using Logistic Regression &amp; Random Forest Classifier

I've done Cirrhosis disease prediction, disease's stage prediction and drug prediction models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest. First I did EDA for visualizing the insights of our data. Then did feature engineering by converting our dataset which includes symptoms and blood tests into categorical values for prediction. Then we use Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier Algorithms for making our predictions models. Then we did the models evaluations by using metrics (precision, recall, f1-score & accuracy), confusion matrix & cross validation score. Then we created a prediction machine, in that machine if any patient entry his/her Age, Sex, Symptoms in Y/N and Blood Tests levels then the Machine will predict that if the patient has cirrhosis disease or not. If the patient has cirrhosis disease, it will also predict the stage of cirrhosis and will also recommend a drug for curing the disease.
